# Parallel Sudoku Solver
This is a small university project done for the "Programmazione di Sistemi Multicore" exam. It's a Sudoku Solver that works in parallel rather than sequential solving, so it's able to solve even the most difficult Sudoku tests in a brief period of time. 
The project has been coded entirely by me and a university colleague, in Java, using threads and forking algorithms.

It scored 30 out of 30 on evaluation, as it could handle even difficult Sudoku tests in very few minutes.
